# Website Format

Our webpage is arranged like a storyboard where you can click a button to move from one slide to the next. 

For our map, you can zoom in and out, and click on prisons to view their restrictions and verall restriction level.

For the barcharts, you can hover over them to receive the datapoints for the given value.

In our linecharts, we have a zoomable brush on the x-axis (time), which allows the user to see more detail in the timeline of donations.
