          This dataset contained the name and location of different prisons, 
          along with the restrictions that those have set in terms of what books they allow. 
          These restrictions could be separated into two parts, common restrictions regarding the condition of the book,
           and additional restrictions which mainly looked at the content within the book.

          To get a more granular view of what <strong>the most 
          common restrictions</strong> look like across different cities and to
          support the task of <strong>sorting the prisoner' books based on their prison,</strong>
          we have created this map.
          <strong>Each circle on the map represents a prison.</strong> 
          When you click the circle, you will find 
          the name of the prison and boolean values to 
          indicate whether each of the common restrictions exists in the prison or not. 
          The color of the circle gives the users an idea of how restrictive that prison is
          with red being that the prison doesn't accept books, orange being that their is a limit
          on the number of books that the prison accept, and blue being that there isn't
          any restriction on the number of books the prison accept.

            The George Floyd group fund has been a point of interest for the organizing committee,

            The third line shows the overall donation count/ amount over time. 
            On the left, we have the count of donations at each instance of time. On the right, we have the total amount received during that time period. 
            A particular time frame can be brushed/ selected to zoom in on the values within that time. By double clicking on the visualization,
